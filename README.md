# A web form using JsonPowerDB
## First project to understand the basic concepts of JsonPowerDB
### Description
This is the project in which I learnt about basics of JsonPowerDB(JPDB) and how to use JPDB for simple database operations. I also learnt CRUD commands. With this knowledge, I have created a form to enter the employees details such as employee ID, employee name and email to store them in the JPDB. 
### Benefits of using JsonPowerDB
* It is simple to use.
* It provides serverless support.
* It minimizes the development cost.
* It reduces the complexity of interoperability of different applications.
* It enhances the data processing performance.
* This is a multi-mode database, as it can be used for variety of data.
* It provides inbuilt support for querrying multiple database.
* It has many security layers that is why data is highly encrypted.
